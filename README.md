# Password Generator

## Description
```
When I joined bootcamp, I knew this is a mission to Mars for me. During my previous 2 assignments, I was just attending the classes detailing the properties of space but this assignment was my first chance  of being in a space suit. I was scared initially but sleepless days and nights for a couple of days made me a little comfortable with this feeling. I am sure there are bigger challenges in store in the future but if I keep my head down and dedicate myself to the mission, I am sure I will be able to reach Mars in the future. 
The password Generator tested my patience and also my skills at researching online for all the answers which I did not have. It is a successful endeavour for me.
